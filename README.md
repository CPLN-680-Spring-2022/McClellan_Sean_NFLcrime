### The NFL's Role in Urban Crime

NFL Football is a sport filled with passion and aggression. These qualities are shared by the fans. While passion at the stadium can make for a fun and competitive atmosphere, these qualities can just as easily result in antinormative behavior such as crime. Exploring crime incidents across time and space in cities with professional football teams answers questions about the effect of NFL football on crime. Furthermore, patterns of spatial distribution and fluctuations in offense type totals can be connected to the success of that cityâ€™s team.
